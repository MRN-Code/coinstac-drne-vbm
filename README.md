# Decentralized Regression with Normal Equation for MCIC Data (coinstac-regression-vbm)

This repository contains code for decentralized regression (normal equation) that was shown to successfully work with the MCIC dataset on coinstac-simulator

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

coinstac-simulator

```
sudo npm i -g coinstac-simulator
```

### Other Notes

There in one main inputspec.json file and four inputspec**.json files in the test folder. The inputspec.json contains an array of the individual input specification for each local site as given in inputspec**.json.
